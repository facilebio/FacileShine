```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## observeEvent({}, ignoreNULL = FALSE)

See also "`NULLflash`" in the code base

`ignoreNULL` deafults to `TRUE`, but turning it to `FALSE` enables:

1. An empty selectizeInput, such as the one provided by the
   `categoricalSampleCovariateLevels` module, to repopulate all of its levels
   when all values have been removed.

2. When `ignoreNULL = FALSE`, you have to be wary intermediate times during the
   reactive cycle when a selectiInput's value is `NULL`. Elaborate on the
   note in the `categoricalSampleCovariateSelectLevels` module found in the
   `observeEvent(input$values, {})` block. This bit me when I had two
   `*selectLevels` modules that were tied to the same `select` module that
   I wanted to make mutually exclusive.
