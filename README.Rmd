The FacileShine package provides shiny modules to interactively query and
visualize data in a FacileDataStore object.

**A note on the experimental lifecycle**: This package is tagged as
"experimental" due to its limited use by a broader audience, and not as
a sign of the commitment to its development or how long it has been in
(internal) use. As we find the edge cases and pain points in the APIs through
broader adoption, we expect to soon move to "maturing" (and eventually "stable")
[lifecycle][lifecycle].
